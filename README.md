# Instagram Clone

![Instagram Clone](https://github.com/DejaLFlynn/instagram-clone/blob/master/frontend/src/assets/instagram_clone.png)




# Motivation:
As my time at the bootcamp I attended winded down, I wanted to recreate a clone of one of my favorite social media apps I used frequently.  This is a app built from scratch that allows users to sign up, login, look at other users posts, and has user uploaded abilities to customize the experience.
